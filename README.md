## Introduction

The field of digital computer architecture has grown explosively in recent decades. This course examines how experimental research, tool development, and theoretical advances have transformed instruction-set architecture design from an intuitive art into a quantitative engineering discipline.

A core focus is the understanding of concurrency—ranging from pipelining to large-scale parallelism—and the architectural structures that support efficient and accessible programming models. These developments have fueled exponential hardware performance gains, a trend that is expected to continue.

Despite this progress, the increasing complexity of hardware systems presents significant challenges. This course aims to address these by introducing techniques to simplify design, leverage fundamental theories for performance gains, and make informed decisions based on technological capabilities and user requirements.
